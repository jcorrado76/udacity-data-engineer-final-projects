This repository is going to house the final projects for the courses in my Udacity Data Engineer Nanodegree program.

Learn to design data models, build data warehouses and data lakes, automate data pipelines, 
and work with massive datasets. At the end of the program, youâ€™ll combine your new skills 
by completing a capstone project.

Projects:
* [Data Modeling with Apache Cassandra]()
* [Data Warehousing with S3 and Redshift]()
* [Data Lake with Apache Spark]()
* [Data Pipelines with Apache Airflow]()
* [Capstone Project]()

Certificate:
* [See my graduation certificate here]()
